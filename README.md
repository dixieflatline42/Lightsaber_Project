# Lightsaber Control Systrem

| Supported Targets | ESP32 | 
| ----------------- | ----- | 

# Features

* ADXL345 Module Implementation via I2C.
* WS2812 Led Strip Implementation via RMT.
* Module MP3 via UART.
* Push botton to fade in or fade out the Lightsaber via ISR.

Attention: All implemetaded but not work together

# RMT Transmit -- LED Strip

Almost any waveform can be generated by RMT peripheral, as long as a proper encoder is implemented. The RMT encoder is used to encode user data (e.g. RGB pixels) into format that can be recognized by hardware.

## How to Use Example

### Hardware Required

* A development board with any supported Espressif SOC chip (see `Supported Targets` table above)
* A USB cable for Power supply and programming
* A WS2812 LED strip

Connection :

```
                              --- 5V
                               |
                               +
RMT_LED_STRIP_GPIO_NUM +------ +---|>| (WS2812 LED strip)
                        DI     +
                               |
                              --- GND
```

The GPIO number used in this example can be changed according to your board, by the macro `RMT_LED_STRIP_GPIO_NUM` defined in the [source file](main/led_strip_example_main.c). The number of LEDs can be changed as well by `EXAMPLE_LED_NUMBERS`.

## Console Output

```
I (302) cpu_start: Starting scheduler on PRO CPU.
I (0) cpu_start: Starting scheduler on APP CPU.
I (323) example: Create RMT TX channel
I (343) example: Install led strip encoder
I (353) example: Start LED rainbow chase
```

### Build and Flash

Run `idf.py -p PORT flash monitor` to build, flash and monitor the project.

(To exit the serial monitor, type ``Ctrl-]``.).
